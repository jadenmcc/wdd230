      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <hr />
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>
        I’m a website builder who also ran an online business selling high-end
        lightsabers to Star Wars fans.
      </p>
      <p>
        Buying a lightsaber is like buying a car in two ways:
      </p>
      <p>
        (1) Every manufacturer uses their own technical jargon to describe
        features that are universally offered. Before you can make accurate
        comparisons and determine which car is right for you, you have to
        translate their jargon into layman’s terms.
      </p>
      <p>
        (2) If you want objective product reviews, your sources are often
        affiliate marketers who have financial incentive to bias you, or online
        forums where you have to sift through endless threads of questionable
        opinions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wouldn’t you have found your last car purchase easier if you had
        apples-to-apples comparisons and reviews, in layman’s terms, between
        makes/models? And all in one place?
      </p>
      <p>
        That’s what my website does: consolidates information about lightsabers
        and translates it into plain English so people can make confident
        purchase decisions.
      </p>
      <!-- change this -->

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>
        Star Wars fans: Men ages 18 to 45 or women ages 18 to 35, single or in a
        relationship; no dependents or children who are Star Wars fans ages 12
        to 17 (male or female). Upper-lower class to upper class income range.
      </p>
      <p>
        They likely attend one or more comic conventions per year, are
        technically oriented or craft oriented, participate in r/lightsabers or
        related Reddit forums, follow professional cosplayers on Instagram, and
        have bought or are intending to buy one or more lightsabers.
      </p>
      <p>
        They love sharing in the fantasy of being a Force user.

        elegance which lends to a sense of authority about what standards should
        be around a potentially expensive toy, and (3) a sense of modernity

      </h4>
      <p>
        (1) It checks all of the boxes for branding previously mentioned, (2)
        it's a good compliment for the heading font because they're both
        sans-serif fonts (good for screen reading) and will help convey
        hierarchy without being too different, and (3) it's pretty close to a
        few of the web safe fonts, so default settings will still be on brand.

        Lightsaber or No? Like most questions in life, the answer to this one is
        going to start with an “it depends”.<br />

        <br />It depends on where you see value (or don’t). In most cases,
        you’re not going to get a non-telescopic lightsaber, that’s at least
        “light dueling” grade, without spending at least $100--and it only goes
        up from there.<br />

        <br />If I hold up a toy lightsaber and tell you it can be all yours for
        the affordable price of $200 and your involuntary reflex is to begin
        reaching for your wallet… Not only are you definitely a Star Wars fan,
        but this may be the right hobby for you.<br />

        <br />On the other hand, if your first reaction to that hypothetical
        offer is a broken chain of incredulous sentences like, “Wha--”, “Why
        would you--”, “But, what is even the point of--”, then I think it’s fair
        to say the lightsaber hobby is not the right one for you.<br />

        <br />So, “lightsaber” or “no”?<br />

        <br />If the proposition of spending a decent chunk of change just to
        realize a childhood daydream sounds preposterous to you, then I’d say,
        “no”.<br />

        <br />If you can look at an aluminum tube, plastic blade, and just
        enough electronics to loosely hold together the impression of a fantasy
        space weapon and still see value in it, then to you, my friend, I’d say
        “lightsaber.”<br />

        Dueling Grade or Just a Replica?<br />

        <br />Alright, you were scrolling on Instagram one night when a
        lightsaber ad hit your feed and now you wondered how you ever thought
        life had any purpose other than to get your hands on one of those bad
        boys.<br />

        <br />You’ve perused enough sites to start getting a lay of the
        lightsaber land and are now wondering whether or not you should be
        preparing to spend the extra money on a dueling grade saber, or if a
        replica will be enough.<br />

        <br />I’ll share a little anecdotal perspective.<br />

        <br />After working in the saber industry and interacting with thousands
        of enthusiasts all around the world, I’d say that this is the journey of
        roughly half of all first-time buyers: it arrives on your doorstep
        (hooray!), you play with it intensely for about a month and are likely
        the only one you know that has one so you rarely find an opportunity to
        smack it against anything other than the occasional tree or bed frame,
        and then you set it in a corner of your room and only pick it up every
        once in a while (like, once a year).<br />

        <br />The remaining 50% can be divided into one of three categories:
        collectors, spinners/cosplayers, and hobbyists. All three are always
        obsessing over their next saber purchase, however only one of these is
        ever really pushing the limits of the hardware’s boundaries:
        hobbyists.<br />

        <br />Collectors just want to show other people where their loyalties
        lie and that’s with the Star Wars universe. They want a saber that will
        impress their friends with its feature sets and will look really cool
        mounted on an office wall or used as the lamp in a man cave. In most
        cases, these are “look but don’t touch” scenarios so you likely won’t
        need anything dueling grade.<br />

        <br />Spinners’/Cosplayers’ primary focus is the TikTok videos they’ll
        make performing their best rendition of an “Ani-Obi” and only maybe will
        make their own dueling video with another friend. At the most, these
        folks will only need something medium dueling grade because they can
        tell their friend to “pull the punches” if they’re getting uncomfortable
        during filming.<br />

        <br />Lastly, the hobbyist. For these folks, the “journey” is the
        destination. They want to understand the ins and outs of the technology,
        of the myth and culture, and they want to be active participants in the
        saber community. They are the most likely to join lightsaber guilds
        where they’ll explore the budding marriage of martial arts and saber
        forms, the end result almost always being... sparring (or dueling).
        These are the folks that definitely should invest in the heavy dueling
        grade sabers.<br />

        <br />So, unless you’re a part of my anecdotal 16% of saber users, you
        can likely skip out on the dueling grade sabers. If you’re not sure
        where you may land or which use cases you’ll end up in, I’d recommend
        getting a medium grade saber at the most and then seeing what happens
        from there.<br />

        Neopixel or Baselit?<br />

        <br />This topic from a rhetorical perspective will likely never be
        solved, at least not until neopixel blades become strong enough to
        withstand heavy dueling forces and have a failure rate of 1% or less.<br />

        <br />From a practical perspective, this topic can actually be summed up
        pretty quickly.<br />

        <br />Are you planning on doing anything other than medium dueling? Do
        you want to be able to play for longer than an hour? Does the extra
        budget required to afford a neopixel and it’s inevitable
        replacements/repairs bother you?<br />

        <br />If the answer to all three of those questions is “no”, then I’d
        say go for it. If not, though…<br />

        <br />Durability. When it comes to durability, base-lit sabers are still
        king. The impact dampening tech used in neopixels is getting better, but
        it still cannot match the durability of an empty, LED-less polycarbonate
        tube. If you do any more than medium dueling, eventually one of those
        LEDs in your neopixel strip will fail and you’ll be forced to replace it
        or repair it if you’re handy.<br />

        <br />Battery life. Despite the improvements in lithium ion battery and
        LED tech, it still takes quite a lot of energy to power all of those
        LEDs in the neopixel blades. Unless you’re willing to use a longer or
        bulkier hilt, there’s nowhere to put more batteries to hold more energy,
        which means you’ll be relegated to about 60 minutes of use per battery
        pack.<br />

        <br />Budget. Most folks have a hard enough time justifying and saving
        up the budget for a $120 base-lit saber. Tacking on an additional $100
        cost for a neopixel blade only makes that harder. Even setting that
        aside, most manufacturers provide zero warranty on the blade. If it
        malfunctions, even due to simple manufacturing defects, you’re now
        looking at another $60-$100 for a replacement, which for a lot of folk’s
        wallets is just adding insult to injury.<br />

        <br />The neopixel’s ability to bring the lightsaber fantasy to a whole
        new level is undeniable. Between the significantly increased
        luminescence of the blade and the life-like responsiveness to stimulus,
        there’s no denying that it is a superior solution. That solution,
        however, still has some corners to round before it makes the base-lit
        LED obsolete.<br />

        <br />In the meantime, if you see yourself throwing your saber into a
        tree (or opponent) at a homerun swing speed, or if you think you’ll want
        to spend an entire Saturday filming your own “Duel of the Fates”
