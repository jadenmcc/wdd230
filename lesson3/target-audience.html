                <p>Name: Mark Treu</p>
                <p>Age: 44</p>
                <p>Education: Associates Degree</p>
                <p>Family Status: Married, Four Children</p>
                <p>Role/Job: Managing Partner/Owner of Consulting Firm</p>
                <p>Goal/Task Pursued on Website: Gather information to aid 
                    him in deciding if he should join the Chamber.
                </p>
                <p>What Matters Most to Them: Having started and sold multiple businesses, 
                    Mark considers himself a self-made man. He values pragmatism and results 
                    over common convention. He's heard other local business owners say the 
                    Chamber has been a value-add for the business, but wants to 
                    check the facts out for himself. He's coming to the site to see
                    what the Chamber says about itself, before having lunch with a
                    few colleagues to talk about their experience as Chamber members.

                <p>Name: Tamara "Tammy" England</p>
                <p>Age: 50</p>
                <p>Education: Bachelor's Degree</p>
                <p>Family Status: Married, Empty Nester</p>
                <p>Role/Job: Owner/Operator of Two Local Boutiques</p>
                <p>Goal/Task Pursued on Website: Gather information about the
                    upcoming "Shop Local" event being hosted by the Chamber.
                </p>
                <p>What Matters Most to Them: Tammy has been a 
                    Chamber member for 7 years. Though her life as a dual-business
                    owner is hectic, she relishes the opportunity to own her own 
                    destiny, explore a creative outlet, and command the freedom to
                    make time for her grandkids. After letting the last two 
                    "Shop Local" events slip by her, she's determined to get 
                    involved in this year's event to leverage it as an opportunity 
                    to network prospective partnerships and, hopefully, break the 
                    revenue ceiling they've been hitting the last two fiscal years.
                    She wants to know which chamber member is heading up the event 
                    and when the weekly planning meetings are to see if she can fit
                    it into her schedule.
